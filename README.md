# stats220

## **This is my repo for STATS 220.** 

### *A little about me:*

1. I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I needed a lighter course in between my more demanding ones.
3. I am interested in learning about the methods of data manipulation in this course.
