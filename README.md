## This is my repo for STATS 220.

### ***A little about me:***

1. **I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.**
2. **I am taking STATS 220 because I needed a lighter course in between my more demanding ones.**
3. **I am interested in learning about the methods of data manipulation in this course.**
